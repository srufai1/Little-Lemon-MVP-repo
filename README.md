Reservation Table System: 
Reserve a Table with Ease 
Overview 
Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant in Chicago, run by two  Ghanaian brothers, Zack and Saeed. The restaurant blends traditional recipes with  a modern twist, offering a seasonal menu inspired by Ghanaian, Nigerian, South  African, and Italian cuisines. The current "Reserve a Table" function on the  website has received negative feedback due to its confusing interface and  unsatisfactory functionality. The goal is to build a fully responsive, modern  frontend application with an easy-to-use table reservation system, enhancing the  user experience.

Technologies 
The following tools and technologies will be utilized to develop the Little Lemon  Reservation Table Booking System: 
1. REST API: Provides a powerful and flexible way to build a table reservation  system, exposing resources and operations over HTTP for seamless client  interaction. 
  
2. React: A popular JavaScript library for building the app's interactive and  responsive frontend, ensuring a smooth user experience. 
3. Git: Employed for version control, allowing tracking of changes, collaboration,  and maintaining a history of the project's progress on GitHub.
4. Figma: Used for creating wireframes and applying design fundamentals,  ensuring UX and UI principles are well-implemented. 
5. Semantic HTML, Meta Tags, and Open Graph Protocol, CSS: Enhances the  structure, accessibility, and responsiveness of the web app, with CSS Grid ensuring  a visually appealing design. 
6. Unit Testing: Ensures the reliability and functionality of the application through  automated tests. 
Challenges 
1. User Experience: 
 - Challenge: Creating an intuitive, user-friendly interface simplifies the table  reservation process. 
 - Solution: Implement UX/UI best practices using Figma for design and React  for dynamic interactions. 
2. Form Validation: 
 - Challenge: Ensuring users input valid data when making reservations.  - Solution: Use Formik and Yup for robust form validation and error handling. 
3. Scalability: 
 - Challenge: Building a system that can handle a high volume of reservations  without performance issues. 
 - Solution: Design a REST API following best practices for scalability, and use  React’s efficient rendering. 
4. Security: 
 - Challenge: Protecting user data, especially during authentication and  reservation submission. 
 - Solution: Implement OAuth for secure user login.
Risks 
1. User Adoption: 
 - Risk: Users may hesitate to use the new reservation system due to  unfamiliarity. 
 - Mitigation: Provide clear instructions, tooltips, and a user-friendly interface to  ease the transition. 
2. Data Integrity: 
 - Risk: Incorrect reservation data due to form submission errors.  - Mitigation: Implement robust form validation and real-time feedback. 
3. Performance Issues: 
 - Risk: Slow load times during peak usage. 
 - Mitigation: Optimize the app’s performance by lazy loading components and  using efficient API queries. 
Infrastructure 
Branching and Merging: 
- Strategy: GitHub flow, involving creating branches for new features, code  reviews, and pull requests before merging into the main branch. 
Deployment Strategy: 
- CI/CD Approach: Automated builds, testing, and deployment using tools like  GitHub Actions, with a staging environment for final validation. 
Data Population: 
- Methods: Initial manual data entry, followed by potential web scraping or data  partnerships to maintain up-to-date information. 
Testing Tools and Automation: 
- Tools: Unit tests with Jest, integration tests with Cypress, and API testing with  Postman, all integrated with CI/CD pipelines.
Existing Product
